# 2048 Game

- I implemented this game to simulate the game 2048 in the Python terminal.
- Players try to create a piece with a value of 2048 by merging existing pieces before they fill the entire board and have no pieces left to merge.
- For each player move, the program shifts all pieces to desired side of the board and merges/multiples equal adjacent pieces to create a large power of 2.
